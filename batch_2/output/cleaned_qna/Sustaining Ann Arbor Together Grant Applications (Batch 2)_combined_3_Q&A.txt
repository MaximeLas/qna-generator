-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Since 2010, Common Cycle has been a community-based nonprofit empowering Ann Arborites to ride bicycles by providing access to education, workspace, and resources. 
After acquiring a rental space of our own last year, Common Cycle piloted a bicycle donation and distribution program. Financial support from the City of Ann Arbor would allow us to expand this successful pilot program. This would substantially increase the number of bikes that we’re able to take in, refurbish and distribute through the social service agencies we currently assist as well as through the recruit and engagement of new partners. 
We propose to collect used bicycles from the general public and UM students, and have them evaluated and refurbished by apprentices from the community under the guidance of Common Cycle volunteer mechanics at our workshop. Refurbished bikes will then be donated to social service agencies for their clients or offered through earn-a-bike opportunities to any individual in need (by volunteering with Common Cycle). Bikes unfit for restoration will be salvaged for parts and used for instructional purposes at the Program to Educate All Cyclists (PEAC) in Ypsilanti or other wise be responsibly recycled. We aim to address several social and environmental challenges through this project. 
We will: 
Prevent bicycles from becoming a waste disposal challenge and expense for the UM campus and the City of Ann Arbor (and in so doing, raise campus and community awareness of easy, yet responsible options for disposing unused bicycles); 
Use collected bikes to teach students and the general public how to maintain/repair their own bikes; 
Offer an opportunity for those in need to “earn-a-bike” or buy one at low cost; 
Supply area social service agencies with bikes for their clients (e.g. resettling refugee families, low-income/ homeless residents, individuals recently released from prison); and
Employ a summer assistant/intern so we can expand our hours open to the community during peak season

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Energy Conservation: 
This project will conserve energy by reducing embodied energy of bikes through reuse; reduce energy used for transportation by offering easier access to non-motorized transportation; and reduce the burden on the city and campus to actively identify, ticket, collect, store and dispose of abandoned bikes. 
Engaged Community: 
Expanding our services through this program will permit Common Cycle to increase our hours of operation and volunteer opportunities to the public. We can increase our educational outreach by providing more bicycle maintenance and earn-a-bike programs, including maintenance courses, drop-in repair hours, mobile events and volunteer bike refurbishing (for donation) and potentially expand hours for our Women/Trans/Femme education and repair night. The program will raise awareness among students and others in the community about better options for their unused bikes. 
Human Services: 
We will coordinate with social service agencies to provide bikes to clients identified with transportation needs (e.g. commuting to work, school, shopping) and recreation. We have provided refurbished bicycles to Jewish Family Services, Catholic Social Services, Avalon House, and to children & families at “bike rodeo” events (coordinated with the Ann Arbor YMCA and Safe Kids of 
Huron Valley) at Ann Arbor & Ypsilanti Public Schools and the University Townhouse Cooperative. With funding and new partnerships, we project distributing 70-100 bicycles in the coming year. Additionally, we intend to stretch A2 Sustainability Grant funds by purchasing safety accessories to accompany bike donations when needed through helmet discounts in cooperation with Safe Kids of Huron Valley and light and lock discounts negotiated with Planet Bike. 
Active Living and Learning: 
This program will expand Common Cycle’s hands-on mentoring to community members in bicycle maintenance and repair skills; Expand our existing community outreach at public schools through bike rodeo events in partnership with Safe Kids of Huron Valley, Pittsfield Parks & Rec, Ann Arbor Police Department, Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Public Schools. At these events, we assess the safety of participant’s bikes and repair as necessary, fit bike helmets, teach safety skills, and provide lights and helmets (where possible). 
Transportation Options: 
This program will increase access to bicycles as alternative transportation options, particularly for those in the community with fewer options. 
Responsible Resource Use:
We will increase the quantity of repurposed bicycles that might otherwise be abandoned, improperly stored outdoors until rendered unusable, and bike frames and parts recycled responsibly. In cooperation with our partner PEAC, every bike will be reused or recycled so that none end up in a landfill.

Start After	->	Grant Deliverables
End Before	->	Timeline

-- Question
What are the proposed grant deliverables?

-- Answer
Our project deliverables will include: 
Bicycle Intake: We will collect unwanted or donated bicycles through multiple means, including bike “turn in” events on the U-M Campus in partnership with the UM Club Sports- Cycling Team and UM Office of Campus Sustainability. We will also take in more bicycles from UM Facilities and Operations, the UM Division of Public Safety and Security, the Ann Arbor Police Department (old patrol bikes) and donations from the general public. 
Community Liaison: We currently coordinate bicycle distribution with Jewish Family Services and Catholic Social Services to identify individuals in need of bicycles for transportation. Our intern will coordinate and expand bicycle distribution to other service organizations. The following social service agencies have been approached and expressed interest in receiving refurbished bikes from us in 2019: Jewish Family Services; Catholic Social Services; Delonis Center; Bryant Community Center; Green Baxter Court Community Center; VA Medical Center, Ann Arbor; Ozone House Youth and Family Services 
Bicycle Distribution: After performing any necessary refurbishing and rebuilding, Common Cycle will work with current and new partner organizations to pair bicycles with their clients. In our pilot project, we distributed 30 bikes to Jewish Family Services and Catholic Social Services. We plan on doubling this number at a minimum and have an upper target of 100 bikes needed as transportation to work or school and for recreation/fitness for children and families in need. Our partner agencies will identify the clients and we will match the bikes to fit each recipient. Furthermore, if successful in securing support for this effort, we aim to include locks, lights and helmets as needed and available, for the safety and security of bike recipients. 
Expanded Programming: Increase hours for community access, public repair hours, education, as well as volunteer opportunities. 
Bicycle Friendly Community Status: Ann Arbor is currently ranked as a “Silver” level Bicycle Friendly City according to the League of American Bicyclists. The Silver ranking is based on the answers the City provides to a series of questions in an application that the City fills out every four years. With the activity specified in the grant, the City will be able to respond more favorably to certain questions.

-- Question
What other funding has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
Our revenue comes principally from individual donors during fundraising campaigns and sales of donated high-value bikes. Last year we raised a record $25,000 from individual donations, $2,000 from grants, and generated $4,500 from sales.

-- Question
What other support has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
We have roughly 50 active volunteers who participated in Common Cycle events last year. Additionally, our all-volunteer Steering Committee and Board Members contributed many more hours to organize events, set up and maintain our workshop, teach classes, build workbenches, attend meetings, fundraising campaigns, etc. In addition, friends of Common Cycle (including members of the public, local bike shops, the Ann Arbor Police Department, etc.) routinely donate bikes, parts, and accessories throughout the year.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured? How will the project be maintained in the future?

-- Answer
The long-term sustainability of our program is a high priority for Common Cycle. We will continue to develop our volunteers’ and board’s ability to fundraise in order to diversify our revenues. Our funding strategies include building relationships with foundations, cultivating support from corporate sponsors and individual donors, increasing revenues from special events, refining our annual appeal process, and exploring income generation opportunities.
