-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
In 2018, the Ann Arbor Summer Festival announced the Festival Footprint Initiative to become a zero waste event within two to three years. This June 2019, after having used compostable beverage cups for two seasons, we made operational and programmatic changes focusing on our outdoor festival offering, Top of the Park, located on the City of Ann Arbor’s Washington Street and spanning the University of Michigan campus at which over 80,000 people from around southeastern Michigan visit over the course of four weeks. 
A2SF implemented the following:  
• We took a massive leap forward requiring all food vendors and caterers to offer only two waste streams: compostable and recycling. We replaced all our cardboard waste boxes with proper, three-stream waste receptacles, and we partnered with 
Zero Waste Washtenaw and Recycle Ann Arbor in recruiting volunteers for each night of the festival. These volunteers oversaw the three-stream waste stations and guided patrons to the correct placement of items in recycling, compost, and landfill receptacles. 
• As a result of this implementation, we reduced upstream waste creation and downstream landfill by implementing three-stream receptacles and staff to guide patrons throughout the site. To call ourselves a zero waste event, we must achieve the industry-recognized 90% landfill diversion rate. In 2018, our rate was 61.3%. In 2019, we jumped to 81.4% and increased our compost removal by 10 tons. Our aim is to officially call ourselves a zero waste event in 2020, but achieving the last 9% is the hardest. We plan on working with advisors and assessing 
2019 operations to reach this goal. 
• We integrated this initiative into our main mission: performing arts presentation. We used our programming and interactive activities to change the way people approach these issues. 
• The City of Ann Arbor provided two A2H2O water stations on the festival site, which provided free water to the public and helped reduce our plastic bottle usage. Additionally, the city donated 400 reusable stainless steel water bottles, which we gave to our staff, volunteers, and festival patrons. While factors such as weather and attendance may have played a factor in our numbers, the water stations and reusable bottle giveaway helped significantly reduce our plastic bottle usage by nearly 
4,000. 
• We implemented an advocacy campaign to help shift public opinion around waste creation and management, which included the creation of the Festival Footprint Zero Waste 
Learning Center, an inviting, interactive, mission-driven area where patrons learned about sustainability and ways to implement it in everyday life. The Learning Center also offered amplification for local and regional organizations and companies to provide an on-site Festival Footprint Zero Waste Learning Center during the 21-day festival attended. Partners offering activities in the center included: The City of Ann Arbor, Toyota’s Terra R&D, Project GreeNZ, Sierra Club, Ann Arbor Public Schools, U-M Gala, Ann Arbor Citizens’ Climate Lobby, DTE, Scrap Box, Washtenaw County Public Works Division, International Samaritan, University of Michigan Gala, University of Michigan Office of Sustainability, Zero Waste Washtenaw, DTE, Bgreen Today, Recycle Ann Arbor, and Food Gatherers. 
We are requesting funding in the amount of $12,496 to support our transition to being a zero waste event, to build infrastructure for a sustainability-focused volunteer operation, and to produce Learning Center activities for another season. 
The expenses surrounding this location include: 
• An interactive art project/sign on the side of the Learning 
Center where festival-goers can add their pledge to a public mural. (See supplementary image attached for reference.)  
• The wage for an on-site Festival Footprint Waste Manager, who trains all our volunteers and manages a small zero waste team.  
• A wage for an administrative assistant to liaise with Learning 
Center participants.  
• An amortized portion of marketing for our Festival Footprint web page 
• A portion of our Programming & Operations Manager’s Salary

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer 
• Engaged Community 
Connecting with and engaging the community is our forté. Due to the length and attendance of the festival, A2SF is uniquely positioned to ensure strong outreach and cultivation community stewardship. We are also are drastically increasing our volunteer numbers to support the three-stream waste receptacles. Not only is volunteerism important to the program, but hopefully, we're spurring people to volunteer for other programs. Ideally, this isn’t just about our needs, but it gives back to the community at large to live beyond our season. In our first year, we held a Long Table Discussion, which is an open dialogue with experts and the community about civic issues. A second Long Table Discussion on how the festival did in our first year of implementation and what methods we can use to encourage festival-goers to take sustainability practices home also took place.  We have a board-chaired Community Engagement Committee that will build on the 2019 Festival Footprint Brain Trust foundation and expand our work. 
• Active Living and Learning 
This is the area in which the Festival Footprint Zero Waste Learning Center is key. We offer a 21-night platform for city, county, and regional groups to reach out to the community. It’s also an opportunity to provide stewardship of community, which is what we already holistically do. Support from Sustaining Ann Arbor Together ensures another year of this valuable platform.  
Additionally, we invite the City of Ann Arbor’s Sustainability and Innovations office to return for the 2020 season to explore how we can support its directive to conserve energy throughout Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County at large. Throughout this process, we’ve had food vendors express interest in changing their products in their brick and mortar stores. Additionally, this initiative has directly impacted the local business of BGreen, who was our preferred vendor in 2019. Compared to other American multi-arts festivals, our small full-time staff of four (4) and a budget of $1.4m to present a month of mostly free arts programming is remarkable. Our regional economic impact in 2018 was $3,554,229, with 366 artists employed.  
• Responsible Resource Use 
At the centerpiece of our Festival, Footprint Initiative is to become a zero waste event by 2020 in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.  In 2019, A2SF reduced upstream waste creation and downstream landfill by implementing three-stream receptacles and staff to guide patrons throughout the site. To call ourselves a zero waste event, we must achieve the industry-recognized 90% landfill diversion rate. We are 9% from this goal, and we are working with advisors reach it this coming season. The City of Ann Arbor provided two A2H2O water stations on the festival site, which offered free water to the public and helped reduce our plastic bottle usage. The water stations and a reusable bottle giveaway helped significantly reduce our plastic bottle usage by nearly 4,000.  We have already spoken with the City of Ann Arbor Sustainability and Innovations Manager Missy Stults about meeting in the fall and winter leading up to the festival on how to improve and expand the A2H2O program. With support from Sustaining Ann Arbor Together, we hope to improve in 2020.  
• Sustainable Energy 
In 2020, we plan on enhancing the Festival Footprint Zero Waste Learning Center by including more compelling and interactive activities. Additionally, we would like to work with current organizations to offer more engaging presentations. One city program we would like to amplify is the A2 Climate Action plan. By working with city leaders, we would like to make this a centerpiece. We also plan to expand the number of organizations represented. 2019 featured 17 entities and organizations for 21 nights. We would like to have 21 different organizations over as many nights.  We set a baseline for our 2018 diesel generator power usage and aim to get the 2019 numbers soon. In 2020, we hope to offset the generator energy with Renewable Energy Credits 
(RECs) from a corporate or governmental entity.  We had conversations about replacing our diesel generator. We are encouraged by our discussions with the U-M Energy Institute, and we would like to include them in the Learning Center for 2020. 
• Local Food 
In 2019, we required all food vendors to employ compostable products. We included an agreement in the food vendor contract requiring each vendor to comply with set rules. All vendors made a concerted effort on a first-year with a learning curve. Some vendors used non-compliant items and changed to compostable items after informed of their error. Others did not or could not modify for sundry reasons. We identified several ways to improve upon this process going forward.  Currently, we’re in the process of transforming our culinary row. We have been considering how we can shift the quality of the cuisine served while focusing on locally-sourced food. Ideally, this will offer other educational opportunities for festival patrons to understand local agriculture and aquaculture resources.

Start After	->	Grant Deliverables
End Before	->	Timeline

-- Question
What are the proposed grant deliverables?

-- Answer
Every season, A2SF produces a program report on the Festival Footprint Zero Waste Initiative. This not only helps us gauge how far we’ve come but where we need to improve. As part of our deliverables to the City of Ann Arbor, we will present this report and meet with city officials to reflect on these successes and growth areas. A copy of the 2019 report is included in our supplementary materials. This year, A2SF greatly expanded its environmental educational outreach through the addition of the Festival Footprint Zero Waste Learning Center. This area offered 21 days of informative, transformational guidance from local and regional thought leaders on environmental topics such as the zero waste movement, sustainable lifestyles, and climate change.  
A large part of our vision for this initiative is to present educational guidance to festival patrons that will help them bring home the festival’s progress in the areas of responsible waste management and reduction. We hope that the materials presented at the Learning Center will service over 4,000 (roughly 200 per night) positively affect reducing, reusing, recycling, and composting behaviors, and initiate a collective, tangible change.  We will provide a report that details our improvements and results for 2020. Our goal is to achieve a 90% diversion rate, so we can begin sharing our tactics and results with other festivals regionally and across the country.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured? How will the project be maintained in the future?

-- Answer
A2SF is an experienced an organizational change in finding investment for new initiatives and looking for ways to integrate it in a sustainable way. Toyota provided seed investment for staff outreach and investment, and we're building this into a desirable program that attracts sponsorship for corporate support and family underwriting as we do with our other programs. The festival will commit resources to upkeep this physical structure. We've included the Festival Footprint Zero Waste Initiative story in all our individual donation requests, which we believe will attract more donor support. From our Brain Trust and all our successful committee and conversations, we will reconvene members of these groups for further advice as the program grows and changes over time.
