-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
The Neutral Zone seeks capacity support to launch a multi-year partnership project with the City of Ann Arbor to build a Job Corps Program that engages the most impoverished and disenfranchised youth (18-24 years old) in targeted employment opportunities that support their health and wellbeing.  
The Job Corps Program will provide a supportive pathway to successfully transition our most under-resourced youth into adulthood through an intentional five stage process by providing readiness, training, mentorship and coaching, job access, and a two-year associate degree. The program will be facilitated by the Neutral Zone, a diverse, youth-driven arts and leadership center. The Neutral Zone will provide the coordination of the program, facilitation of the trainings, ongoing coaching for 2-4 years, and program evaluation. The City of Ann Arbor will support appropriate access points to entry level jobs, city employees to mentor participants, and connections to other city departments for education and community building. In addition, the program will connect to key partners – including Washtenaw Community College, Michigan Works, Ann Arbor Transit Authority, Ozone House and Corner Health - to ensure appropriate resources are available to support the youth engaging in the Job Corps Program.  
Over the next five months, the Neutral Zone seeks support to build the capacity of this project to ensure it is ready for a pilot launch in July 2019. More specifically, Neutral Zone is seeking the financial support to dedicate the staff time to support building community partnerships, develop training curriculum, create evaluation tools, and outreach efforts to launch the pilot program.
