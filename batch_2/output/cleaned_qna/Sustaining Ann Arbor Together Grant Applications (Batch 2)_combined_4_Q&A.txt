-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
The Cobblestone Farm Market (CFM), an event of the Cobblestone Farm Association (CFA), is a neighborhood market in southeast Ann Arbor that is committed to providing its neighboring residents with fresh, naturally grown produce, quality baked goods, locally made crafts, and hot food from local restaurants. Beyond physical goods it provides a community meeting space for families and other neighbors, with an array of kids activities and rotating musical acts that enhance the overall experience. The Cobblestone Farm Museum house is open weekly during the market with guided tours to give a glimpse into the rich history, often overlooked on the property. Cobblestone remains Ann Arbor’s only market dedicated to providing only natural grown produce, meaning no synthetic chemicals or GMO’s.
Our goal is to enhance and support the sustainability of our farmers market and others in the area as a means of providing access to local food with a focus on supporting beginning farmers and start-up businesses. Specifically, we will implement this at the CFM by developing practices and resources that are replicable for other farmers markets:
-explore the possibility of small farmers markets being a hub/node of the downtown market develop ways to enhance participation of the local community with a focus on low-income members develop a series of presentations and a supplemental take-home resource for community members (adults & children) 
-history of local food  
-utilizing local/seasonal foods 
-cooking/recipes  
-food storage/preservation 
-develop a replicable resource for other markets to do the above at their own markets 
-develop a marketing strategy to increase awareness of food assistance (EBT, Double-Up Bucks etc.) at farmers -markets, and the importance of local food 
-develop materials that promote other City sustainability goals, specifically: 
-sustainable modes of transportation: walking, biking, busing, etc. 
-zero waste goals 
-develop a 5-yr business plan as a foundation to ensure the long-term sustainability of the CFM

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Energy Conservation: Reduce energy consumption and eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions in our community/Reduce CO2e emissions 
- The centralized neighborhood location of the CFM allows nearby residents to walk or bike to the market. We also continue to encourage patrons to utilize these sustainable modes of transport as well as bus in their other travels. 
- Purchasing locally grown and produced food reduces miles food traveled. 
Engaged Community Goal: Ensure our community is strongly connected through outreach, opportunities for engagement, and stewardship of community resources 
-The market has done and plans to increase outreach to the diverse communities that surround it. Opportunities for engagement include volunteering at the market, attending the market, utilizing it as a community gathering space for socializing, eating, shopping, music, and educational and children’s activities.  
Human Services  
- Provide services that meet basic human needs of impoverished and disenfranchised residents to maximize the health and well-being of the community 
-In addition to the above, food assistance programs are available and encouraged 
-Funding would help to further expand these programs and ensure their complete implementation  
Active Living and Learning:  
- Improve quality of life by providing diverse cultural, recreational, and educational opportunities for all members of our community. With additional funding, the CFM would be able to enhance, expand and make available to other outreach entities family oriented entertainment, educational activities including seasonal and cultural activities, and direct engagement with farmers. These activities will deepen participants understanding of and appreciation for the local food system.  
Transportation Options: Establish a physical and cultural environment that supports and encourages safe, comfortable and efficient ways for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users to travel throughout the city and region 
-Create a Travel Demand Management program that uses social and targeted marketing to encourage more residents to walk, bike, and bus to their destinations.  
-Having a neighborhood market such as the CFM encourages more residents to walk, bike, and bus to their destinations
-Create a citywide go!pass program that combines bus use incentives with biking and walking incentives 
-CFM could provide incentives/education at the market to reduce GHG emissions, mainly in transportation uses 
-CFM is located in a neighborhood which allows for sustainable, safe transport for families and children. The sidewalk entrances into Buhr Park offer many children access to the market without having to cross the street or come upon major roadways. 
-CFM vendors grow food and produce products locally which reduces miles that the food has to travel

-- Question
What are the proposed grant deliverables?

-- Answer
The CFM committee hopes to grow the Cobblestone market into a sustainable part of the community and to collaborate with other markets and local food access entities to greatly broaden the use of local foods in Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County. 
Specifically, the following will be provided by the end of the grant term: 
For Cobblestone:  
-a schedule of activities to be implemented through partnership with the Cobblestone Farm Museum to -displays comparing the food of the late 1800’s with local, seasonal food available at the market. 
-a reliable event space where community can gather to engage in the local food scene and each other’s company 
-as part of the marketing strategy and educational strategies: yard signs, banners, flyers, social media marketing, display boards, and incentives for returning patrons 
-a 5-yr business plan that includes: fundraising strategies acquisition of infrastructure items (tables, tents, signs, etc.) a potential transition to a year round market expanded collaboration with Cobblestone Farm Museum 
-an increase in vendors, in the variety of items available for sale, in the number and diversity of market patrons, and in vendor sales 
For all local markets: 
-a marketing/education strategy developed and implemented that includes the availability of food assistance (EBT, Double-Up 
Bucks etc.) at farmers markets  
-educational resources developed and available in electronic and take home form (with paper or display board replication capacity) to include the following topics:  
-the importance of buying local including impacts on local economy, food security and farmers 
-how to’s: set up cooking and other food related demonstrations 
-food storage and preservation 
-seasonally available produce 
-a booklet of recipes 
-history of local food  
-a list of children's activities focused on local food systems 
-materials that promote other city sustainability goals: 
-how to run a zero waste market 
-how to increase sustainable modes of transportation to access the market: walking, biking, busing, etc. 
In broader terms, a serious look into collaboration with other entities working on the question of how to most effectively increase the amount of local food circulating within our communities would be a part of our efforts. CFM aims to pursue how can transition the culture of buying food anytime anywhere to one with greater awareness of buying locally at given times.

Start After	->	How will project be maintained
End Before	->	Right-of-Way Usage

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured? How will the project be maintained in the future?

-- Answer
The business plan will be implemented. The paid manager position is responsible for recruiting and managing vendors, marketing efforts, volunteers, and other duties. Core volunteers/market committee members assist in running the market, distributing food assistance benefits and bookkeeping. Adding on a volunteer coordinator will help ensure the market has a reliable and consistent volunteer pool. Increased growth of the market will warrant an increase in vendor fees which will support a more sustainable market, although studies have found that no farmer’s markets are totally independently sustainable. They all need some outside support. The market committee is working on a resolution to generate some form of city partnership with the markets to keep them viable.
