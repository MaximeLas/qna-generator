-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Children’s Literacy Network (CLN) is proud to present BookPALS, the first program of its kind in the nation. Inspired by the concept of “pen-pals,” this program employs an evidence-based Peer Assisted Learning Strategy (“PALS”) to accomplish two goals: promoting the development of fluency, vocabulary and comprehension skills while at the same time building bridges between students who come from very different socioeconomic communities and cultural backgrounds.
For the 2020-2021 school year, second graders from low-income schools in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti will be paired with peers from near-by schools in Dexter who have compatible reading levels and interests. Each month a BookPAL picks a book, practices reading with a trained volunteer mentor, records themselves reading on a tablet, writes a letter, and answers questions about themselves. The books and letters are delivered to the paired school, recordings viewed and the whole process repeated each month. Over the year the pals’ friendships and home libraries grow, along with their love of reading. In May the BookPALS will gather together for a celebration day, participate in a final book exchange, and enjoy fun activities together. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and recent social justice protests highlight the pervasiveness of racism in the country and in Washtenaw County. The principals participating in BookPALS recognize that the need to educate toward diversity and equity is now even more critical than ever before, and have requested that CLN choose a newly published book, “Are Your Stars Like My Stars?” as a launch book for this year’s program. The book is the perfect text for the BookPALS students to read as they begin to learn about children from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. Students will continue to engage with the launch book in book discussion groups and activities throughout the year. CLN and school administrators believe that the book’s messages of connection, diversity and universality are especially timely and will resonate with students this year.
CLN anticipates that the pandemic may impact this year’s BookPALS program with occasional and even long-term school closures. For this reason, the program has been adapted to pivot online as necessary, and will include numerous opportunities for students, teachers, and volunteer mentors to interact in online book group discussions and individual meetings. CLN is requesting funding from the Sustaining Ann Arbor Together Neighborhood Grant Program to purchase 275 copies of “Are Your Stars Like My Stars?” This generous funding will enable all the second graders at Mitchell, Pattengill, and Pittsfield elementary schools to participate in the program, as well as additional Ann Arbor students who will be able to participate remotely. BookPALS is expanding from 400 to 600 students for the 2020-2021 school year - CLN is proud to bring the BookPALS program to Ann Arbor students.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
CLN’s main goal is to ensure all children have what they need to succeed in life. We want them to be prepared for kindergarten, to excel in school throughout grades K-12, and have access to literacy support for that success. This is our dream, and our vision for Washtenaw County. As a community, the only way to bring this vision to life — for all children — is to align as a collective force and make literacy a central priority.  BookPALS furthers the Active Living and Learning Sustainability Framework Goal, and is a powerful example of how we can work together to improve quality of life by providing diverse cultural, recreational, and educational opportunities for all members of our community.
When CLN proposed the idea of BookPALS to educators around Washtenaw County, administrators enthusiastically adopted the idea and clamored to participate. It was simply something that had not ever been proposed before. Leaders in education know the importance of providing equitable opportunities and reducing community gaps in public education. But putting such ideals into practical budget-responsible solutions is not a simple matter, and inequities often persist.
In fact, in Washtenaw County, there is a 35-point gap on third-grade reading tests between black and white students. This disparity alone signals that this is an urgent time for schools and community organizations to work together to close the achievement gap and to ensure that children’s success in school is not defined by their zip codes or their race.
With the passage of Michigan’s controversial “Read by Grade Three Law,” students who are not reading proficiently by the end of third grade can now be retained, potentially affecting self-confidence and future success. Students who repeat a year between kindergarten and fifth grade are 60 percent less likely to graduate high school than children with similar backgrounds (Andrew, 2014). 
To address the reading proficiency crisis in low-resource schools, CLN chose a powerful yet underutilized educational tool, PALS, (peer-assisted learning strategy) as a cornerstone of the BookPALS program. Studies found a significant increase in oral reading fluency rates for participating low-income students and indicated a positive relationship between oral reading fluency and increased ability levels. Multimedia enhanced book-buddy programs were also highly successful in improving reading comprehension scores. Most notably, PALS influenced students’ attitudes toward reading, including the development of cooperative skills and friendships.
By intentionally focusing on second graders, BookPALS is helping to reverse our current literacy crisis by empowering children, directly increasing their reading proficiency, enjoyment, motivation, and self-confidence at this pivotal, high-impact time in their educational pathway. Academic program outcomes include increased practice reading time which will directly improve students’ oral reading fluency and encourage the development of vocabulary skills and comprehension strategies (Brooks, 2016).
CLN is also dedicated to helping students succeed by fostering social growth. BookPALS provides second grade students in the dissimilar communities of Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor and Dexter with an exceptional opportunity to interact and form friendships, connecting them across racial, socioeconomic, and cultural gaps – enhancing and entwining academic and social growth.  BookPALS’ innovative approach goes beyond the academic needs of students to achieve reading proficiency. It also helps break down prejudice and assumptions students may have about people who come from different places or backgrounds and do not look or sound the same, contributing to enhanced intercultural understanding. All children, whether they live in low-resourced or more affluent neighborhoods, can benefit from exposure to children who are different from them. All students need the benefits of diversity and anti-bias education to understand the world as it is today. At this moment, CLN appreciates that children have fears and concerns, and have been impacted by this spring and summer’s unprecedented events. CLN knows that “Are Your Stars Like My Stars?” will allow children to have real conversations – even more than before, BookPALS has the potential to change lives.

Start After	->	What will be the grant "deliverables"?
End Before	->	Project timeline

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
Grant deliverables include:
• The distribution of all 275 copies of “Are Your Stars Like My Stars?” to students in late September
• Using the book in October meetings between the BookPALS
• Using the book in November larger book group discussions 
• Referencing and using the book throughout the year for other activities, both in person and virtual
• Hosting the author and illustrator for virtual visits in December and in-person visits in May. 
“Are Your Stars Like My Stars?” is an integral part of this year’s BookPALS program, because it is so specific to what is going on in children’s lives and the lives of their parents and teachers during this unprecedented time in history. The book will be used in school assemblies to introduce students to the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion and utilized in many other ways over the course of the year. The first online book discussions, during which the students will see and hear their new friends for the first time, will be centered around this book. And, in the second month of the program, larger “book club” groups will discuss the book and its message of diversity and inclusion. Other titles used in BookPALS throughout the school year will link directly to these same topics featuring characters of color and diversity, as well as themes of inclusion. In this way, the launch book will provide an important reference point for students when they read and discuss the other books.
CLN will reach out to the author and illustrator of the new launch book, and we hope that they will be able to “drop in” to visit the BookPALS virtually. In addition, we will invite them to attend the May end of the year celebration in person, bringing the importance of the launch book full circle. If we are not able to have a live event, we will bring them to the virtual event.
Other deliverables include meeting the BookPALS’ measurable objectives. Of the 600 students to be served:
• The number of children reading with sufficient accuracy and fluency to support reading proficiency at grade-level will increase by 25%. 
• Increased oral reading time will directly increase oral reading fluency. 
• Increased vocabulary will have a significant positive impact on reading achievement scores by a statistical significance of 7% increase.
• Students will have increased access to new books and books of diversity. 
• 65% of students’ reading motivation and confidence will increase.
