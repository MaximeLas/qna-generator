Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Peace Neighborhood Center Family Services - Maple Road Corridor 2020 will be focused on addressing the academic, social, emotional and recreational needs of our youth along with heading off the issue of food insecurity in the home during the crucial transitionary phase of moving youth into an online learning environment. During the summer, there will be in-person and online academic support for youth four days a week every morning for all grade groups with special assistance for young people enrolled in Ann Arbor Public School's Summer Learning Program.  Meals will be served throughout the summer at all of our sites, followed by pop-up activities that will rotate through bringing special arts, crafts, science projects, reading activities, outdoor games and all sorts of fun things to support the social, emotional, physical and academic well-being of the youth we serve. At the conclusion of the summer program in August, special reward trips will be organized for small groups of kids to connect in a safe manner. 
As participants transition into the school-year, Peace will be providing an increased on-site presence at our West Arbor and Maple Meadows satellite centers up from two days per week last year to 3-4 days per week this year depending on enrollment size.  These activities will aid young people in the transition into the virtual learning curriculum that will go into place in Ann Arbor Public Schools this fall. Meanwhile, Peace Neighborhood Center's Family Enrichment Program will be providing parents with special instruction and hands-on training with Ann Arbor Public Schools' new Schoolology online learning platform. Case managers and Youth Services staff members will work with each family in order to make sure each parent and child fully understands the ins and outs of this new virtual learning environment.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Human Services - Provide services that meet basic human needs of impoverished and disenfranchised residents to maximize the health and well-being of the community. All of the services Peace Neighborhood Center provides seek to address the needs of the Maple Road Corridor community by offering quality effective youth programming, family enrichment activities and case management aimed at eliciting systemic change and neighborhood revitalization. According to a study conducted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation:
“In the United States, children born to parents in the lowest fifth of the income scale are quite likely (42%) to end up there as adults. Similarly, children of parents in the highest-income group are very likely to stay there (39%). Upward mobility has proven particularly difficult for African-American families to sustain. Fully 45% of black children whose parents were solidly middle-income end up falling to the bottom of the income distribution, compared with only 16% of their white peers.”
The key to addressing this systemic issue lies in addressing the family as a whole with supportive services in addition to providing effective youth development programming capable of leveling the playing field.  In the wake of the Covid-19 shutdown and subsequent shift to an online learning environment, this need has only become more prevalent.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
Peace Neighborhood Center's Family Services are an annual ongoing function of the organization for nearly 50 years.  Residents of the Maple Road Corridor are the highest priority recipient of the services offered.  This is even more so the case in the midst of the Covid-19 response.  While we are hopeful that the social distancing safety measures currently being employed will not need to be maintained into the future, we are very certain that Family Services programming and the funding necessary to run them will be maintained in the future. Peace Neighborhood Center actively searches for untapped sources of revenue and has financial controls in place that ensure efficient use of existing resources. It is our distinct belief that we will be successful in our fundraising goals across a diverse spectrum of sources including foundations, corporations, churches, individuals, special events and government agencies. Additionally, Peace Neighborhood Center has established a reserve fund capable of sustaining at least three-months of operational costs for the agency should unforeseen circumstances arise that impact the agency’s ability to provide services.
