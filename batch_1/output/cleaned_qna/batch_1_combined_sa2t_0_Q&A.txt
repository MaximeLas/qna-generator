-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Generous funding from the Sustaining Ann Arbor Together grant program will help provide socio-emotional and academic support services to “high risk” Girls Group students attending AAPS.
The Mission of Girls Group is as follows: Girls Group empowers young women to achieve emotional and economic self-sufficiency by ensuring they graduate from high school and begin their college or career journeys. Programming spans middle school, high school, and continues through college and careers. Participants are mentored by experienced staff and interns. Year-round comprehensive programming focuses on academic readiness, social / emotional life skills, financial education, and community service.
Girls Group has been a nonprofit organization for 17 years, and serves 600 girls and young women. We build long-term and lasting relationships with girls, young women, and families, starting in 6th grade and continuing through middle school, high school, college, and career.
Girls Group families live in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti and are often defined as “low-income” and “high-risk”: - 61% of middle school and high school participants qualify for free or reduced lunch - 79% of participants live in a household with an annual income under $50,000 - 84% of participants identify as a person of color
Due to the impact of the pandemic, the financial instability of the young women we serve (and their families) has significantly deteriorated, from the data collected above.
Girls Group participants are at a greater risk for academic and financial setbacks, especially during this global health crisis. Their families already have less income, assets, educational attainment, and social capital (personal and professional networks). In the current coronavirus environment, Girls Group participants and their families are at an even higher risk for academic and socio-emotional setbacks, including mental health crises, food insecurity, and long-term financial hardship.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
The proposed project will further the Ann Arbor Sustainability Framework goal of Community, or, “ensuring access to basic needs and services while empowering community members”.
For Girls Group participants, sheltering at home and completing school online means missing major milestones, lack of positive peer environments, and loss of typical routines that help them to feel safe and supported. The results of these compounding struggles have the potential to impact the families we serve for generations.
Research shows that traumatic events, like the current global health crisis, have major and long-lasting impacts on students’ lives, including how much they are able to learn and long-term factors like college enrollment and income.
For students that struggle more than their peers, like those served by Girls Group, experts agree that they need additional educational and emotional support now and when they return to school. Additionally, due to health disparities and the effect of COVID-19 on African American communities, many Girls Group participants know people who got sick or died from contracting the virus. Girls Group is working to address the trauma these students are facing right now.
During this pandemic, Girls Group is focused on providing increased academic guidance and social-emotional support services. This event is incredibly traumatic for Girls Group participants who already suffer from high levels of anxiety and economic uncertainty.
The current disaster is likely to leave many students behind academically for years to come, and could lead to meaningful loss of income over the course of their lifetimes. Girls Group is working to prevent this reality. Prolonged school closures will have real long-term negative effects on the entire cohort of socio-economically disadvantaged students served by Girls Group.
Our overall approach to addressing the inequities intensified by the pandemic is to ensure that all Girls 
Group participants attending Ann Arbor Public Schools have access to basic educational resources and socio-emotional support by:
- Securing the equipment and resources students need to meet academic requirements, including laptops/kindles and the internet. (We also help identify students/families whose basic needs aren’t met and provide direct referrals to community resources).
- Providing impactful mentoring that helps students feel emotionally supported through the major and negative impacts on their educational achievement, mental health, safety, and security.
The ultimate ambition of Girls Group is to end generational poverty. We take an evidence-based approach to this vision by focusing on educational attainment of young women as the primary catalyst. We recognize that in order to overcome the current crisis, graduate high school and get to and through higher education, young women need skills, support, and resources.
Girls Group college and career readiness programming begins with the development of a college mindset in middle school and high school. Once a participant has the skills, understanding, and knowledge they need to excel socially and academically, Girls Group provides focused college and career preparation support to assist students in preparing for life after high school, and navigating the college admissions process.
Girls Group uses a strengths-based approach to college and career readiness, focusing on two primary themes:
- Academic Resilience: meeting academic requirements to graduate high school and possessing the skills to succeed in college, including confidence in your abilities, creating a success-oriented environment, and capacity to find and use academic resources. 
- Social-Emotional Wellness: the belief in your capacity to pursue your dreams, overcome obstacles, recognize, name and manage feelings, and foster resilience through a survivor vs. victim personal narrative.
Girls Group is committed to providing community services that improve social-emotional wellness and academic resilience, through remote and/or in-school programming. We use a trauma-informed lens to increase access to quality education, and ensure access to meaningful and impactful academic guidance and mentoring. Our work is guided by economic and educational equity, which is needed now more than ever.
With support from the Sustaining Ann Arbor Together grant program, Girls Group can achieve our mission of empowering students to complete high school, college, and set goals for successful futures.

End Before	->	Project timeline

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
Grant deliverables will include improved social-emotional health, academic resilience, a growing college mindset, and long-term educational, emotional, and economic self-sufficiency. (Girls Group has a consistent evaluation process that ensures we track our progress, and we also implement “lessons learned” on a regular basis.) Girls Group is committed to breaking the cycle of generational poverty by supporting young women in completing high school, college, and setting goals for successful futures.
In response to school closures and mandated social distancing, Girls Group developed distance learning and remote programming methods that engage and motivate students. Girls Group remote programming is designed, facilitated, and led by 11 full-time staff and 8 social work interns. Girls Group strategies include:
- Working with Ann Arbor Public Schools and Comcast to secure necessary laptops and home internet access.
- Offering an educational/socio-emotional curriculum that includes creative and culturally-responsive topics, sessions, and activities focused on improved educational outcomes.
- Giving students/caregivers an opportunity to share their concerns, and address the difficult questions on their minds in age-appropriate ways.
- Utilizing outreach resources (email addresses, phone numbers, and newsletters).
- Providing consistent weekly individual and group programming, to foster a sense of safety and predictability (emphasizing academic readiness, relaxation, and stress/anxiety reduction).
- Offering individualized and group support to meet a wide range of student needs.
- Continuing targeted college admissions support to both high school juniors and seniors (essays, applications, scholarships, determining the best financial aid packages, helping with emotions of leaving their families, etc.).
Girls Group currently works with 22 rosters of AAPS students (individually, and in groups). Programming is conducted remotely during the pandemic, and follows a Girls Group curriculum focused on academic and social-emotional growth.
Participants are served in the following cohorts:
- 12th grade students at Huron, Skyline, Pathways, and Community High (5 rosters)
- 11th grade students from Pioneer, Huron, Skyline, and Pathways (CCP group services)
- 9th - 11th grade students at Pioneer, Huron, Skyline, and Pathways for Success (4 rosters)
- 8th grade students at Clague, Scarlett, Tappan, Forsythe, and Slauson (5 rosters)
- 7th grade students at Clague, Scarlett, Tappan, Forsythe, and Slauson (5 rosters)
- 6th grade students at Scarlett, Slauson, and Forsythe (3 rosters)
Our strategy of early and long-term engagement is key to breaking the cycle of generational poverty. When the cycle is broken, the entire community benefits from the upward mobility of successful young women.
With support from the Sustaining Ann Arbor Together grant program, Girls Group can provide academic and social-emotional support services to hundreds of vulnerable young women and their families in Ann Arbor. Due to Girls Group’s structure of working with students long-term, the benefits of college and career readiness programming will strengthen year over year.
Immediate benefits will include improved social-emotional health, academic resilience, a growing college mindset, and long-term educational, emotional, and economic self-sufficiency.
