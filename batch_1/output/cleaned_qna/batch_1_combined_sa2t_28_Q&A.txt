Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Located in downtown Ann Arbor, the Delonis Center serves over 1200 single adults experiencing homelessness in Washtenaw County each year. Many of these clients with no other options call the Delonis Center a temporary home. By offering three meals a day in the Food Gatherer's Community Kitchen, SAWC welcomes anyone in need of a hot meal to the Delonis Center. Also, SAWC welcomes many community partners to meet with clients, such as Michigan Works, Legal Services, HAWC, Dawn Farm, Home of New Vision, and Community Mental Health partners. In addition, SAWC has well over 1,000 community volunteers that support the operations of the shelter programs, including local Art Break Studio who has art sessions with clients once a week.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
The landscaping revitalization project aligns with the community goals as SAWC's plan is to engage community partners and clients to work alongside one another to complete the landscaping. This project will promote an engaged community as stewards and consumers of services are working together toward a common goal. In addition, this aligns with human services goals as the Delonis Center serves over 1200 persons a year who are needing shelter and basic need services. The landscaping project also aligns with resource management goals as it will promote cleaner air by planting additional trees in downtown Ann Arbor.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
SAWC will start the landscaping revitalization project in early Spring of 2021 by using new layout materials for groundcover, shrubbery, trees, flowers, and also include a seating area for clients in the front of the Delonis Center. Currently, there are rocks for the layout, no flowers or trees, and some shrubs. In addition, there is no seating area other than a bus stop in front of the building, which forces clients to sit in the grass/rocks, or at nearby businesses.
