-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Creekside Court Community Center is currently under-construction with completion estimated in the Fall 2020 and will serve the newly housed families that were previously homeless. This facility will be providing a variety of basic need services including food assistance, community building services, and year-round educational supports for K-12 youth. The building costs are fully covered but filling the space with much-needed furniture, equipment, and supplies are uncertain and are a critical aspect to ensuring these new families receive the resources that they need the moment they move-in. This grant will support the acquisition of essential, low-energy consuming refrigeration and freezers for the on-site food pantry, dynamic modular furniture designed for multiple purposes (ex. tutoring, community meetings and events, food distributions), and other critical supplies.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
The bulk of this project is to cover the procurement of essential equipment and supplies. The equipment in particular minimally has a 7-year warranty and anticipates its continued use well beyond 10 years. The equipment makes up nearly all of the project expenses and CAN's history of leveraging community contributions and grant funding provides a fairly reliable base for continued service delivery.
