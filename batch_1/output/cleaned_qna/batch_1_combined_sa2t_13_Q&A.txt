-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
We believe every child deserves to be celebrated with a gift and cake on their birthday and we want to offer this simple pleasure to all kids in need in the Ann Arbor school district. Currently, we work with social service agencies and school social workers but with a grant we can expand our services to the 1000 families who are picking up food boxes each week from the Ann Arbor school food distribution program. 
This could give over 2000 kids a SMILE on their very special day. Our unique program does not provide generic presents. We try to give each birthday child something they want, something to do, something to read and something to hug! We also provide a small gift for other children in the household so that it is a family celebration. Each birthday child also receives a simple hand-made Wish Candle to keep.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Our project supports the Community Service area of sustainability. Specifically, our services meet your goal of helping with the basic human needs of impoverished and disenfranchised residents to maximize the health and well- being of the community. Supporting families in our simple way strengthens our ties to each other, promotes community equity by closing gaps between the haves and have-nots, and actively demonstrates that everyone (especially children) deserves to be celebrated.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
Our self-promotion will expand as we reach out to businesses, PTO's, organizations, the media, and others to raise awareness, sponsorship and additional funds. We are conversing with similar organizations around the country (Beverly's Birthdays for example) for guidance and advice on growing into an organization that offers the community even more options and we will be surveying the families we serve to confirm that we are best meeting their needs. We will also expand our board to include a leader with fund raising expertise, a current Ann Arbor business leader and another social service professional.
