-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
Educating young people about the environment and climate change will raise awareness and encourage them to practice a greener and healthier lifestyle and behavior. Lifestyle change is a continuous process, by starting them young the possibility of adapting the new lifestyle will be transformational. This solution has the opportunity to scale beyond the 4 local YMCAs and engage additional community stakeholders such as corporate sponsorships to meet funding needs. Also, with the YMCA established relationship to partner stakeholders, the support and continuity of the project will be guaranteed through a memorandum of agreement to adapt and continue the said program. Thus, this strategy can also be integrated through YMCA camps, leadership trainings and other programs.
