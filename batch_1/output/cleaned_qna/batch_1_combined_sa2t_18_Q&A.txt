-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
CAN requests funding to make its largest community center, Bryant, a resiliency hub for the community. “Resilience hubs” are facilities that are designed to support residents before, during, and after natural hazard events. This means that when the power goes out in a neighborhood (e.g. due to a fallen electrical line), that neighborhood will still have power because of the solar-powered resiliency hub that has enough solar stored up to be a resource for the community as needed. It is important that these hubs are both geographically and equitably dispersed throughout the county so communities that are disproportionately impacted by power outages can have a sense of security when those events occur, especially as weather becomes increasingly extreme and threatens vulnerable communities.
CAN has been partnering with Homeland Solar to gauge the solar capability of each home in the Bryant neighborhood; our contact there has extended this work and completed a solar assessment of the Bryant Community Center. As a result, CAN is pleased to provide this proposal for 6.4 kW of additional rooftop solar, plus 2 – 16 kWh backup storage batteries at Bryant Community Center, 3 W. Eden Court in Ann Arbor. This will be an addition to the existing 6.67 kW solar system. The new panels will be located on the east/west facing roof sections closest to the existing solar system. To maximize resilience of the Community Center, the currently installed SolarEdge 6.0 kW inverter will be removed and replaced by one of two SolarEdge 10kW Energy Hub inverters. This inverter upgrade will maximize output of current from the two batteries. The two 10 kW inverters will also support the addition of significant solar capacity in the future as budget permits.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Broadly, CAN works to close socioeconomic gaps by providing educational and enrichment programs for children and teens, supportive services for families who are under-resourced, and challenging systems rooted in racism and inequality. CAN views this project–and its environmental justice work more broadly–as natural extensions of its existing work to help families be more resilient. That said, the Bryant Resilience Hub furthers Goal 1-No Poverty by mitigating the stress on families during hazardous events. It also contributes to Goal 7-Affordable and Clean Energy because CAN is promoting solar energy, a source of power that is clean and helps lower the cost of utilities for the user. Furthermore, this project also contributes to Goal 9-Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure because the Center is setting an example of clean infrastructure for the whole community; the visibility of Bryant’s solar panels will spur conversation among residents in the neighborhood and connect those that are interested in solar with the resources they need to install them on their own homes. Lastly, because this project contributes to CAN and the City’s larger decarbonization project in the Bryant community, it also contributes to Sustainability Framework Goal 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities. CAN was one of A2ZERO’s first collaborators and we are extremely excited by the opportunity to take one step closer to truly sustainable and resilient communities.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
The deliverables for this grant will be additional solar panels and batteries that will be installed at the 
Bryant Community Center. These new panels will provide the Center with 6.4kW of additional rooftop solar, plus two 16 kWh backup storage batteries. To maximize the resilience of the community center, the old solar inverter will be replaced with two SolarEdge 10kW Energy Hub inverters. The addition of this equipment will not only make the Bryant Community Center a resilience hub, but it allows the system to have the capacity to add additional solar panels in the future as the budget allows.

-- Question
What other support has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
A member of Homeland Solar has been partnering with CAN pro bono for more than a year to complete solar assessments for the Bryant neighborhood. He also completed the assessment on the community center and will be CAN’s point of contact for the installation of the equipment.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
This project will be maintained moving forward by familiarizing Bryant facilities staff with the equipment and training them on how to identify any issues that may arise. This will ensure that the solar is maintained on a daily basis. Additionally, Homeland Solar will continue to be a resource for CAN and they will perform regular reviews on efficiency and safety of the equipment. The City of Ann Arbor has also identified Bryant as a partner neighborhood as the City works toward the creation of a Sustainable Energy Utility that focuses almost exclusively on energy generation through behind-the-meter solar and energy storage systems installed on homes and businesses across Ann Arbor. With this municipal support and attention to the increased use of solar, this new resilience hub will be an important piece to the puzzle in helping Ann Arbor become the first carbon neutral city in the country.
