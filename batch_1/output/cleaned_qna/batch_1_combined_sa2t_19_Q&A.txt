-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
The Recuperative Care and Housing Crisis Stabilization programs operate within the Delonis Center in downtown Ann Arbor to serve persons experiencing homelessness that need immediate shelter due to medical and/or a behavioral health crisis. Within these programs, vulnerable persons will have part time nursing support and intensive case management for housing and referrals to community resources for stabilization. These specialized shelter programs also bridge the relationship with local health systems including hospitals and Washtenaw County Community Mental Health to partner with the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County (SAWC) in serving our most vulnerable neighbors. Recuperative Care was piloted in August 2019 to offer immediate shelter to persons discharging from the hospitals without a home to recuperate. The Housing Crisis Stabilization program will accompany in August 2020 with additional beds for the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health to refer persons in crisis needing stabilization, shelter, and support. SAWC is seeking equipment and supplies to operate both programs to offer a welcoming temporary shelter that fits clients' needs.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
The operation of both Recuperative Care and Housing Crisis Stabilization programs meet community goals. In partnership with the health systems the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County is encouraging an engaged community to serve and coordinate the well being of persons experiencing homelessness. Through the referral process for clients to enter the programs and also the care coordination that each program entails, this partnership is promoting engagement and outreach into the community. Both programs are also offering a basic human service need of shelter and supportive case management to locate affordable housing.Without these programs, more persons would be living on the streets without basic need services as there is a 4 to 6 week waiting period to access residential shelter for single adults in Washtenaw County. This is due to limited shelter beds; however, both programs reserve beds for immediate access when health systems identify a person in need.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
Additional specialized shelter beds are needed to serve persons in both programs. The Recuperative Care Center is seeking funds to purchase at least 3 medical beds that will aide persons that are unable to transfer themselves to and from the bed due to physical limitations. Often there are clients discharging from the hospitals into the Recuperative Care Center that would benefit from these medical beds. In addition, with the Housing Crisis Stabilization program starting in August 2020, SAWC is seeking funds to purchase 4 new shelter beds to offer emergency shelter to additional persons that are experiencing a mental health crisis. Lastly, the Recuperative Care Center, located on the second floor of the Delonis Center, is in need of lounging furniture to set up a living area for clients to feel relaxed and call a temporary home as they recuperate. Currently, clients only have their bed areas to relax and they are in need of additional furniture.
