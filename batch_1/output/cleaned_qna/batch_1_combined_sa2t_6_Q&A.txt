-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Common Cycle is proposing a Universal Basic Transportation (UBT) pilot in partnership with the Community Action Network’s Bryant Community Center (BCC) located in the Bryant/Arbor Oaks/Stoneybrook neighborhood in southeast Ann Arbor. The Bryant Community Center is a current Common Cycle partner, and the proposed work would extend this partnership as well as support the Bryant Community Center’s core mission and its efforts to become the first carbon-neutral neighborhood in the country.
This program would have several components (described below) that all support the goal of providing affordable and reliable transportation to residents of the Bryant neighborhood and the tools, knowledge, and workspace to keep riding. The proposed program would complement our bicycle distribution program which was launched with the support of a previous SA2T grant.
Currently, our bicycle distribution program seeks to provide a free bicycle (as well as a lock, lights, and a helmet) to anyone in Ann Arbor who needs a bicycle but cannot afford one. This is done through partnerships with social service agencies that support underserved populations in Ann Arbor. The proposed program would allow us to pilot a more robust support program in partnership with a single community, exploring how access to free bicycles, educational programming, and equipment for safety and maintenance can help Bryant residents of all ages access, utilize, and maintain bicycles to meet their daily needs.
The components of the proposed program include:
Bicycle Distribution: The core of our program includes distributing a safe, refurbished bicycle along with any needed accessories (e.g., helmets, locks, lights, fenders, racks, and bags) to up to 50 residents, both youth and adults in the Bryant community and any additional persons who participate in the Food Pantry run by Bryant. Common Cycle receives a steady flow of bicycle donations from the community and after repairing and refurbishing these bicycles, they would be passed on to Bryant residents, similar to our existing distribution program. We will work with the BCC team to determine eligibility and coordinate the distribution of bicycles, which may be done on a rolling basis over the grant period.
Education and Programming: Along with access to a free bicycle and accessories, we would coordinate education-focused events on-site at BCC. These workshops and events would be run in conjunction with BCC’s regular community programming and would be open to all BCC residents, not just to those participating in the UBT pilot.
Key workshop topics: Introduction to BCC workspace and tools; Basic maintenance (e.g., Fix-a-Flat, routine maintenance); Intermediate maintenance (e.g., replacing brake pads, annual inspection); Road safety; How to store and secure your bicycle; How to load and unload bicycles from racks on AAATA busses; Other topics as requested by participants and Bryant residents Rider clinics, including youth-focused “bike rodeos”
Workspace and Tools: We would like to purchase and install a permanent, full-service bicycle workbench outfitted with a toolset, pump, bike stand, and consumables (i.e., lubricants, tubes, cables, and cable housing) for use by BCC residents to implement their bicycle repair skills and maintain bicycles on-site over the long-term. This would also be an asset when running repair pop-ups with BCC as part of the UBT pilot program. This resource would also complement the FixIt station installed by the City previously, which is very well-used according to BCC staff. 
Supplemental Transportation Assistance: We are also seeking to support BCC residents’ supplemental transportation needs by providing free or discounted bus passes. This would provide an alternative to cycling during unsafe or inclement conditions or when riding is not feasible. We have already secured a commitment by the AAATA to obtain passes at a discounted rate. Passes would be free to Bryant residents participating in the UBT program who do not otherwise qualify for free fares (see letter of support from Lilliane Webb).
Needs Assessment and Evaluation: We hope to perform a needs assessment within the Bryant community to ensure our approach and program goals align with the community's needs. Based on that feedback, we would alter components of the program as needed. Additionally, we will administer a pre- and post-survey to UBT pilot participants to assess the impact of the program on their personal vehicle miles traveled and use of active transit solutions, we well as inform program iteration and improvement. We may also administer a mid-program survey to allow for program refinement within the grant period.

End Before	->	Sustainability Grant Information

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Energy Conservation: 
Using alternative transport such as bicycles and buses reduces vehicle miles traveled and therefore personal carbon emissions significantly. More bikes in use reduce the number of bikes that end up in a landfill.
Engaged Community: 
We plan to run this program with the BCC community, not just for the BCC community. We will engage the 
Bryant community at all stages of the program, including early on to assess needs and ensure we are meeting genuine needs in the community. 
Human Services: 
Our program will address affordable, reliable transportation - a basic human need.
Active Living and Learning: 
We expect the bicycles we provide will be used for both transportation and recreation which will provide an active transit and recreation option for program participants. This will have an important role in maintaining the health of the community members and potentially reducing obesity and diabetes in this population. Hands-on educational programming is also core to our organizational mission and to this program. 
Transportation Options: 
The heart of this program is to provide active, healthy, and low-impact transportation options to the Bryant community.

What is the project timeline? When will it be finished?

-- Answer
We expect to launch the project upon receiving the notification of funding. Our hope is to kick off the program in July 2022 and complete the project by June 2023.

-- Question
What other support has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
We have counted at least 750 hours of volunteer effort since we reopened in June 2021. Additionally, our all-volunteer Steering Committee and Board Members contributed many more hours to organize events, set up and maintain our workshop, teach classes, build workbenches, attend meetings, fundraising campaigns, etc. In addition, we have robust community support as measured by our popular weekly public hours, regular bicycle donations, and donations.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
The basic infrastructure required to support this program is already in place as a result of our successful previous SA2T-funded pilot program “New Wings for Old Bikes” through which we grew and further developed our bicycle distribution program. Since then, we have distributed and sold hundreds of bicycles through our network of partner organizations and our semi-regular garage sale events. This proposal represents an expansion of that work that we plan to integrate into our bicycle distribution program in the long term. This expansion will be informed by our experience over the grant period. We expect the lessons learned through this pilot will allow us to appropriately extend and expand a UBT program to other communities.
The work proposed here will allow us to deepen our bicycle distribution network and expand the services we provide to ensure that those individuals who receive a bicycle through our distribution program can continue to take full advantage of that bicycle for years to come. It has the added benefit of allowing us to better understand the needs of community members related to active transportation. 
After the grant period, the tools purchased for use at BCC will be the property of BCC and will be retained there. The cost of expendables used for bike repair (tubes, lubricant, etc.) after the program period will be covered by donations and if required, by the BCC budget. We anticipate the cost expendables to be approximately $10/year/operating bike, so if there are 50 bikes in operation this will be $500/year.
