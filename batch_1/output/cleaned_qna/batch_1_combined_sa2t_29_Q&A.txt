-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Built in 2005, Carrot Way is one of Avalon’s largest family sites, with thirty (30) one-, two- and three-bedroom units.  We have worked hard to keep the property a beautiful place to live. As we have seen families grow and new families move in, we see a need to update our playground equipment so that it continues to be  a place kids want to play. It's a huge benefit to our families to have a place right outside their door where their children can spend time outside, interacting with other children, and getting physical activity.  Beyond simply replacing aging equipment, we are also focusing on a wider range of ages with this proposal, ensuring the older kids also have an engaging, healthy, outdoor environment. Updating our playground structures to be more appealing to a broader age range of kids will help us better serve residents.
