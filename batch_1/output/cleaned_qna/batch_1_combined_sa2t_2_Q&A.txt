-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Funding from Sustaining Ann Arbor Together would allow Girls Group to further invest in our Youth Leadership Program. 
Girls Group started in 2003 and was incorporated as a 501c3 organization in 2006. Girls Group currently serves 690 girls and young women who are generally economically disadvantaged and have the potential to become first-generation college students and graduates: 300 middle school students, 150 high school students, and 240 young women on their college and career journeys. These young women reside primarily in Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor.
The Mission of Girls Group is as follows: Girls Group empowers young women to achieve emotional and economic self-sufficiency by ensuring they graduate from high school and begin their college or career journeys. 
-Programming spans middle school, high school, and continues through college and careers
-Participants are mentored by experienced staff and interns
-Year-round comprehensive programming focuses on academic readiness, social / emotional life skills, financial education, and community service.
Girls Group supports young women to become first-generation high school and college graduates. We begin building a college mindset in 6th grade, and continue services throughout middle school, high school and college/career. We facilitate weekly programming within the schools and work closely with families. We “meet each girl where she’s at” with year-round programming including weekly curriculum, field trips, college tours, and summer programming to build academic and social emotional skills. Youth leadership programming generates a greater sense of community and engagement for Girls Group participants. The input and perspectives from Youth Leaders help us identify problems/solutions, share information, and understand what is working and not working for the young women we serve. 
Research shows that young people who are actively engaged in community leadership opportunities have three core strengths:
-Capacity: Knowledge, leadership and action skills.
-Motivation: Understanding and awareness of issues and root causes, systems, strategies for change, commitment and a sense of responsibility.
-Opportunity: Chances to act on passions, use skills, and generate change through relevant sustained action.
Girls Group’s ultimate ambition is that each young woman finds their voice, defines their goals and dreams, and moves forward in the world with pride and self-confidence. Young people want and deserve a voice in their communities. Girls Group centers this in our work and wants to offer more leadership opportunities to the high-potential youth we serve. At the individual level, youth often report involvement in Youth Councils led to improved confidence, self esteem, and sense of purpose.
Girls Group strives to center youth voices and empower young women to be leaders and mentors. We will continue to invest in our greatest asset, the young women that shape and define what we do, in order to create change for current and future generations. 
Funding will support the expansion of the 2021 Pilot Youth Leadership Council. We will actively work to identify high-potential leaders across 5 high school sites, Youth Leaders who may be too afraid to say “yes” or are unaware of their leadership potential. We will work with these participants to increase their confidence, abilities, and potential through engagement in the Youth Leadership Council. Girls Group has seen the benefits of having youth-led programming. The Youth Leadership Council group sessions have inspired other young women to be leaders, own their voice, speak their truth, and inspire others to own and speak their truth. In the words of Michele Harper, “there is tremendous relief in speaking, in letting go of the judgment of others, in the heroism of being willing to heal”. 
Youth Leaders will create “safe” spaces that increase the sense of community and visibility felt by students who are considered members of marginalized and oppressed communities (Black/Brown students, LGBTQ+, those with disabilities, etc.), and “brave spaces” that emphasize the following five key elements:
-“Difficult conversations” (an environment where different opinions are validated and accepted).
-“Owning intention and impact” (group members will acknowledge and discuss situations where the conversation -has affected the emotional well-being of another person).
-“Challenge by choice” (group members will have an option to step in and out of challenging conversations).
-“Respect” (group members will respect one another’s basic dignity and human worth).
-“Healthy relationships” (group members will agree not to intentionally inflict harm on one another).
Leaders will meet with staff to design session content and activities on a biweekly basis. Girls Group staff will have a limited role, supporting and guiding leaders, sharing knowledge with youth about logistics of facilitation, helping leaders practice new skills, and acting as a sounding board to solve issues if/when they occur. Leaders will have full ownership and autonomy over the design by picking topics, designing materials, and using their own experiences. They will independently facilitate group discussions and middle school workshops that are fun, imaginative, creative, and engaging. Leaders will debrief sessions with staff, talking about what they learned, what went well, and how to improve sessions for the future.
This ongoing learning process/cycle will begin with planning sessions, followed by facilitating sessions, then debriefing and planning the next session. This will happen continually throughout the school year. During the final retreat, Youth Leaders will reflect on their experiences, plan for future leaders, and discuss lessons learned for the future of youth-driven spaces and youth leadership at Girls Group.

End Before	->	Sustainability Grant Information

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
The proposed project will further the Ann Arbor Sustainability Framework goal of Community, or “ensuring access to basic needs and services while empowering community members”.
At Girls Group, we support an “Engaged Community” and “Active Living and Learning” by providing enrichment and leadership opportunities for Girls Group participants. We focus on empowering participants to become leaders in the community, graduate high school, pursue college, use their skills and experiences to mentor family, friends, and other young women, and ultimately achieve emotional and economic self-sufficiency.
As an agency, we have reflected and learned that youth are the experts in their own lives. Youth voice is essential to our work as a youth agency. In the words of a Girls Group young woman, “The community that was built with my peers and mentors encouraged me to share my voice.” Girls Group empowers young women in middle school and high school to achieve emotional and economic self-sufficiency by graduating from high school and becoming first-generation college graduates and ultimately breaking the cycle of generational poverty. Programming is designed to help young women develop into confident, empowered, healthy, and successful individuals. Programming activities as a whole are designed to teach problem-solving, decision-making, and leadership skills that are critical to navigating the challenges of growing up. Building on this foundation of belonging and life skills, participants set and reach goals, specifically graduating high school and getting to and through higher education. This path is the foundation for our vision: that all young women in our community will be emotionally and economically self-sufficient.
Girls Group uses four central themes to design programming that prepares and supports participants on their path to higher education:
-Academic Readiness: The beliefs, attitudes, and skills needed to meet academic requirements, self-advocate, and persevere to overcome obstacles.
-Social-Emotional Readiness: The beliefs, attitudes, and skills to manage emotions, develop healthy relationships, set positive goals, and pursue dreams.
-Financial Empowerment: The beliefs, attitudes, and skills to pursue employment, be empowered to take ownership of financial decisions, and achieve financial stability.
-Community Service Learning: Recognizing your greatness by engaging in quality community service learning that develops social awareness, builds character, and expands possibilities.
Girls Group works with each system of a participant’s life, including families, schools, and other community supports. We meet participants “where they are at” in their journeys, honor their experiences, and carefully develop methods that are effective and collaborative. Girls Group uses a wraparound approach to increase the likelihood participants are supported academically and socially/emotionally throughout each step on their path to success. Girls Group prepares students for success by organizing year-round comprehensive programming to establish college and career pathways and building relationships with adults in the participants’ lives including mentors, teachers, guidance counselors, and family members. Through year-round programming, Girls Group connects participants with community resources to support their educational experiences, create new skill-building opportunities, and provide personal and professional connections. Programming spaces also create a continuous supportive community of peers to rely on and share successes and challenges.
Girls Group has a proven record of providing individualized and group high-quality services, resources, opportunities and mentoring to students most in need. By providing services they may not receive otherwise, Girls Group directly impacts the likelihood participants will graduate from high school and pursue higher education. Since the beginning of Girls Group, 240 participants have defied the odds and graduated from high school. Girls Group’s programming is holistic, comprehensive, and more effective for the following reasons:
-We connect with participants early, introducing a college and career mindset in 6th grade.
-We provide an array of services, including academic tools, mentoring, career guidance, and job readiness experiences (such as career exposure, job shadowing, and networking opportunities).
-We follow youth development principles (positioning participants as resources and partners in developing and evaluating programming).
-We provide financial incentives (transportation, materials, supplies, tools, exam fees, and scholarships).
-We provide long-term, follow-up services for as long as necessary.
Girls Group is extremely proud of our success helping socioeconomically disadvantaged young women defy the statistics, graduate from high school, and pursue college. Girls Group helps to break the cycle of generational poverty by empowering young women of color to become economically and emotionally self-sufficient. Since the beginning of Girls Group, 100% of Girls Group high school seniors have defied the odds and graduated from high school. The Youth Leadership Council builds off this success and further empowers young women to define their goals, strengthen their leadership skills, and be role models to Girls Group participants, their peers, and their community. With support from the Sustaining Ann Arbor Together grant program, Girls Group can achieve our mission of empowering students to be leaders and mentors in our community.

-Youth Leaders will participate in a meeting with all Girls Group staff at the end of the school year to share lessons learned and establish next steps. (Girls Group has a consistent evaluation process that ensures we track our progress, and we also implement “lessons learned” on a regular basis.)
We believe in the abilities of young women, and value their thoughts, ideas, and contributions as equals. We want to take what we know to be true in our hearts, and continue to align our practices with our values. At Girls Group, our goal is to expand leadership opportunities that are written, driven, and led by the young women we serve.
With your support, Girls Group Youth Leaders can explore their identities and reflect on who they want to be in the future. Participants will gain skills in problem solving, organization, planning, management, creative thinking, innovation, goal setting and group processing. At the end of this project, Girls Group Youth Leaders will leave a legacy and be a role model for Girls Group, their peers, and their community.
