Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
The Ornithological Society of Pioneer (OSP) is a club that spans four Ann Arbor Public High Schools and aims to promote birding and bird conservation among youth. To help further our mission, we plan on launching “Bins for Birders," a project that would involve purchasing seven pairs of beginner birding binoculars and one spotting scope. These would be used by club members and the general public attending guided weekly bird walks in Ann Arbor Parks. This initiative is important as it strives to enhance equity, inclusion, and diversity in the birding community. Dates, times, and locations of bird walks will be announced on social media platforms (e.g. Instagram @o.s.pioneer and the Washtenaw Audubon Society Facebook page) and these will be open for the general public.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
This initiative promotes the following Sustainability Framework Goals: "Engaging Community," "Active Living and Learning," and "Healthy Ecosystems." OSP is rooted in our commitment to staying connected with the community through weekly walks and organized presentations that educate students about the importance of bird conservation. Additionally, birding is an outdoor activity that drives youth to explore their community parks and encourages them to live an active lifestyle. Moreover, birding is a wonderful way to meet others, explore issues of equity/inequality in the birding world, and teach others about how birding can bring us together culturally. Connecting over birding helps bridge certain demographics, such as socioeconomic status, religion, and racial background. Finally, protecting birds also protects the environment in that it promotes healthy ecosystems. Birds play a crucial role in each ecosystem like Ann Arbor’s deciduous forest and riparian habitats, to name a few. When people spark an interest in something, they develop an appreciation and take ownership of it. Then, they are much more willing to fight to preserve it. Our birding club brings together youth that is engaged in learning and preserving the natural environment of Ann Arbor - the first critical step in developing a sustainable community. We hope to expand this goal to the general public of Ann Arbor.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
Successful completion of these goals will be measured by the frequency of use of the binoculars and scope throughout the year. We will maintain a detailed log of the date, location, and individual who used the tools. We also hope to increase the number of young birders that attend the weekly walks through advertisement of this program. OSP was founded in fall 2020 and we started with 15 members. Now, after only one year of activity involving participation in the local bird counts, conducting Birdability surveys around town, and giving one oral presentation at the Freeman Environmental Eco-symposium, we have 115 registered members. We are confident that the availability of these tools will enhance our ability to recruit and retain members and, as a result, increase the number of students who are committed to furthering this program’s mission. Starting additional birding clubs at the middle school level and helping students prepare for the Washtenaw Elementary Science Olympiad “Feathered Friends” event are goals of our club and will provide additional measures of success.

-- Question
What is the project timeline? When will it be finished?

-- Answer
Once funds are received, orders for binoculars and a spotting scope will be placed promptly and should be delivered within two weeks. We expect that these supplies will be available for public use within a month.

End Before	->	How will the project be maintained

-- Question
What other support has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
Users of “Bins for Birders” would dedicate at least two hours a week to bird walks. Sightings will be recorded in eBird, a global citizen science database of ornithological research maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. During these walks, our club also completes Birdability surveys for each Ann Arbor park that we visit. Birdability is a national nonprofit whose mission is to share the joys of birding with people who have disabilities and other health concerns. By completing these surveys, we put Ann Arbor on the Birdability global map and highlight the helpful features of Ann Arbor parks that allow birders with accessibility challenges to take part in birding. Also, users of “Bins for Birders” will take part in the annual bird counts, including the Christmas Bird Count and May Count (organized by the Washtenaw Audubon Society), that are crucial to studying resident and migrant bird populations, respectively, in Washtenaw County.

How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
We anticipate that OSP will continue to hold weekly walks in Ann Arbor parks for years to come and thus, will keep providing club members and the general public long-lasting opportunities to use these tools.
