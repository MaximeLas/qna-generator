-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
In 2018–2019, CAN Art & Design, with funding by KaBOOM!, worked with the students who participate in CAN’s free after-school and summer programs at Bryant to design and install a “Drop Shot” basketball court and playscape on the center’s property for recreation. This major project has transformed the empty back yard, originally rendered useless due to drainage issues, into a multi-hoop basketball playscape to encourage outdoor play in a safe space where the community can gather. The community itself was involved in a variety of ways throughout the design process, construction, and final aesthetics.
Sustaining Ann Arbor funding will support the design and construction of a companion space for gathering and study. In line with the CAN Art and Design's HOMEState curriculum being implemented in 2020–2021, which includes units on Michigan nature and innovation, CAN intends to use the same community-informed design process to create a raised garden bed to provide space to grow fresh produce and custom-built permanent tables and benches under a pergola—a space for families to gather and for the children and youth to do homework and still enjoy the outdoors. CAN A&D would include the children and teens living in the Bryant neighborhood in the design of this space through the after-school art program so that the outdoor classroom meets their direct needs and interests. We will then organize a series of weekend building workshops for families and neighbors. Sustaining Ann Arbor funds will be used for the materials needed to create prototypes and construct a permanent raised community garden bed, solar lighting, and pergola from the prototypes.
