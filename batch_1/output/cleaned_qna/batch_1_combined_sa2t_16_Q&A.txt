Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Michigan Ability Partners (MAP) is a private non-profit agency that has been creating opportunities for persons living with disabilities in Southeast Michigan since 1985. MAP assists over 1,500 individuals each year who are in search of housing and/or employment opportunities. 
The agency’s Housing Program works with residents of its MAP HDC, LLC affordable housing that includes two sites for veterans and three sites of permanent supported housing. Programming offers not only affordable housing, but case management support for daily living skills development and increased self-sufficiency, while addressing barriers to permanent housing. Currently, MAP HDC, LLC owns six transitional and permanent housing sites within the City of Ann Arbor, including Whispering Creek, Maple View, Willow Pond, Kilbrennan, Hemlock and Rockland. MAP seeks funding to support the beautification and creation of community gardens at its permanent and transitional housing locations within Ann Arbor. Beautification projects will occur at all six sites, but community gardens will be created at Whispering Creek, Maple View, and Willow Pond. The project will engage MAP HDC, LLC residents, MAP staff and volunteers through the months of August and September. The goal of the project is to give residents an opportunity to connect with their community, provide sustainable and fresh produce for three of MAP’s housing sites, and beautify each property.
