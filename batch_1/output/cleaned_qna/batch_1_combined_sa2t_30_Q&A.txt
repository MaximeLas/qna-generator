-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Pilot-building bench-marking metrics & date for energy, wateruse and commuter transportation data for A2 2030 District Buildings and share individual dashboards with building owners. The dashboard will benchmark the buildings' energy and water use against the 2003 CBECS data base and will have the capability of bench-marking transportation based on a commuter survey administeredevery two years. The project includes complete ASHRAE LEVEL II audits for at least 6 city buildings and bench-mark.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Strategy 3 (Significantly improve the energy efficiency of our homes, businesses, schools, places of worship,recreation sites and government facilities): The project will bench-mark any building in the city that wants to be bench-marked and can pave the way for a bench-marking ordinance and provide a data for creating the Green Business Challenge. Building owners can measure their progress on reducing energy & water use along with GHG reductions.
Strategy 4 (Reduce the miles we travel in our vehicles by at least 50%): The project will develop a transportation survey and baseline for buildings in the district, establishing a way building owners and businesses can measure their progress.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
1. Building Dashboards tracking energy, water (and ultimately transportation) for any commercial and multi-family building in the City of Ann Arbor that wants to participate
2. District-wide aggregated dashboard that is published on the A2 2030 District website
3. Transportation survey and baseline to benchmark building and district progress in reducing commuting vehicle miles traveled
5. Monthly Programs that will educate building owners/managers, businesses, architects and contractors on implementing the A2 Zero Carbon Neutrality Plan

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
The building dashboards are automatically updated through updates to the building Energy Star Portfolio Manager databases. Currently, building owners and the A2 2030 District enter building data. Buildings can be added at an time. The A2 2030 District is working with the City of Ann Arbor to automatically load water information. The transportation survey will be administered every two years by the A2 2030 District.
