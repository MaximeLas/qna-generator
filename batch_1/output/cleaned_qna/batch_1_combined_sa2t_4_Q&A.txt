-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Avalon Housing owns and manages several non-profit supportive housing properties located throughout the City of Ann Arbor. During the summer of 2022, we have ambitious plans to create more environmentally sustainable, pollinator-friendly habitats at all of these properties.  At each property, we will design, install and maintain landscaping that incorporates native plants.  In addition to beautifying our properties for our tenants and neighbors, we aim to reduce maintenance and watering, attract bees, butterflies and birds, and eliminate the need for fertilizers, herbicides and/or pesticides.  Avalon's two groundskeeping staff will work with groups of community volunteers to clean each of the identified beds at our properties, amend the soil, install native plants and mulch.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Avalon Housing's Pollinator Program will further the Sustainability Framework Goals of Resource Management and Community.  Avalon aims to be better stewards of our natural resources and contribute to cleaner water and air by planting native plants that require less watering and no chemicals to cultivate and maintain. We'll save the energy that would be required to grow and replace annual plants each year by instead using native plants, which are resilient perennials. We'll also contribute to a healthier ecosystem by creating pollinator-friendly habitats at our properties throughout the City. Finally, we'll create community by engaging our neighbors (both tenants and other community members) as volunteers in the creation and maintenance of these garden beds throughout the City for years to come.
