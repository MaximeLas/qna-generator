-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Currently, there are no substantial efforts to engage the youth of Community Action Network (CAN) in the sustainability of their communities. To introduce the impacts of climate change and the importance of sustainability to our youth, CAN’s Art & Design (A&D) program will be developing the Environmental Sustainability curriculum. This will be a 12-month arts-based curriculum with the goal of making these high-level concepts accessible to even the most novice of students. The A&D curriculum will incorporate a series of themes to aid in understanding our relationships with our environments, including climate change, sustainability in the water and on land, sustainability of the food we eat, and community involvement. Students will participate in hands-on, creative projects that will boost their knowledge of the environment, encourage students to be more conscious of it, and teach effective sustainability tactics for a healthier future. Projects will include a variety of mediums such as photography, painting, sculpting, community installations, and more. A host of experts in the realms of art and environmental sustainability will assist in the production of this curriculum to educate and support our youth. CAN requests funding from The City of Ann Arbor to develop its annual thematic curriculum for the 2022-2023 school year. Grant funds will not be used for the implementation of the curriculum, only the planning/development of it. If this curriculum is to have a lasting impact on the youth that CAN serves, a significant amount of human time and effort must be devoted to ensure the material is accessible, engaging , and practical. Funding will help support the following expenses: 40% of the Director of Education’s time at $28,000; AmeriCorps VISTA cost share at $11,000; Other CAN staff at $5,000.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
Broadly, CAN envisions the closing of socioeconomic gaps by providing educational and enrichment programs for children and teens, supportive services for families who are under-resourced, and challenging systems rooted in racism and inequality. Therefore, all of CAN’s programs and services contribute to the Reduced Inequalities goal. CAN’s education programs seek to meet students’ basic and foundational needs by providing a safe, nurturing environment in which students can eat nutritious meals, play, receive academic assistance, participate in enrichment activities, and develop healthy relationships with peers and adults. Because the Environmental Sustainability curriculum will be implemented in CAN’s education programs, the proposed project inherently furthers the Quality Education and Zero Hunger goals. CAN’s education programs also infuse social-emotional learning and mindfulness into the daily routine, thus this curriculum will also work toward the Good Health and Wellbeing goal through activities and by taking a mindful approach to sustainability. The curriculum itself will further the Sustainable Cities and Communities goal by exposing youth to the idea of community sustainability and showing them tangible things that can be done to make their communities more resilient, sustainable, and safe for all.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
CAN will use grant funds to develop and plan its thematic curriculum for its education programs for the 
2022-2023 summer and school year. In order for that to come to fruition, the CAN Art & Design team must recruit local experts in the field of sustainability, as well as other youth-centric experts, to collaboratively brainstorm ideas including themes, lessons, structure, and more. The Summer Camp Advisory Committee will be the first deliverable for this grant, and the 2022-2023 Environmental Sustainability curriculum will be the second deliverable. Six units will be developed along with lessons for each, and a roadmap for the school year where students will take deeper dives into each unit.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
CAN A&D’s thematic curriculum for a given year is planned during the school year and implemented beginning in the summer through the following school year. Because this grant will assist in the development of the Environmental Sustainability curriculum, CAN’s A&D team and educational program staff will ensure it is maintained and continuously implemented throughout the year. In terms of longer-term maintenance of concepts learned through the curriculum, CAN intends to continue to pursue more environmentally sustainable initiatives in the under-resourced communities with which we partner. CAN is already working with the City of Ann Arbor’s Office of Sustainability and Innovation on a neighborhood sustainability project in CAN’s largest community (Bryant), Northside Community Center is now a climate resilience hub, and other initiatives such as the Hikone Community Greenspace and nationally-recognized butterfly garden are examples of things CAN is already doing to support the sustainability of our communities. Doing more explicitly sustainability-related work in CAN communities will help youth internalize concepts they learned about and have the opportunity to witness and participate first-hand. This will also further instill the gravity of this work because youth will get to see how climate change is already impacting their communities. In other words, this will not be a one-and-done curriculum; themes and concepts learned will play an increasingly important role in youths’ lives and the work that CAN does.
