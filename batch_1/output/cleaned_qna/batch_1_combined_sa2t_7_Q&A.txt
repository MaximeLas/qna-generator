-- Question
Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Our goal is to promote plant-based eating by partnering with the Office of Sustainability and Innovations (OSI) to introduce individuals to popular plant-based items, such as Beyond Burgers, plant-based milk, Earth Balance butter, JUST egg, and more, completely for free! Since VegMichigan began this program in November 2020, we have given away more than 2,000 bags of full-size plant-based food items. The feedback from our surveys show that participants will definitely be adding more plant-based foods to their routines, and as a result, reducing their carbon footprints. This program adheres to the city’s Food Sustainability Framework by lowering greenhouse gas emissions in each participant’s diet, supporting local food systems where possible, and featuring products that do not harm the environment and other life forms.
We plan to distribute a minimum of 500 free bags of popular plant-based foods to residents of Ann Arbor in exchange for participants making a pledge to reduce their consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy. VegMichigan will provide helpful resources and a mentor to help participants during the 30-Pledge. At VegMichigan, we work to introduce individuals to plant-based foods in a way that is familiar to them, and we pride ourselves on creating positive and welcoming outreach that is free of judgment so that participants realize there is no sacrifice when it comes to eating plant-based for their health, animals, and the environment.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
This project will directly support the city’s Resolution in Support of Good Food Procurement Policies by encouraging residents to make healthier food choices that respect farm animals, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and support local food businesses. 
According to research specialist Dr. Martin Heller at the Center for Sustainable Systems in U-M’s School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS), Beyond Burgers have “a significantly lighter environmental footprint—from a sustainability perspective—than production of traditional beef hamburgers” and compared to traditional beef burgers producing a Beyond Burger “requires 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly 50% less energy”. And a recent study in Science Journal found “dairy milk production results in about three times more GHG emissions and requires approximately nine times more land than plant-based alternatives.” 
The United Nations has also acknowledged that a global shift toward diets free of meat and dairy is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change. This program features products that taste delicious and are more sustainable, including Beyond Burgers and two different plant-based milk options, both of which use less water and land to produce than cow’s milk, while also supporting local food systems wherever possible, including Ann Arbor-area businesses like Vedge Cafe, Detroit Street Filling Station, People’s Food Co-Op, and Argus. It also highlights the nutritious and satisfying options available to residents without harming the environment or other life forms.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
The deliverables for this program will be quantifiable, including the number of bags distributed (i.e. the number of participants), the number of local options featured in the bags (i.e. featured items from local businesses, like Vedge Cafe or Detroit Street Filling Station), and a special sign-up form for Ann Arbor residents to use.
Participants will receive four full size food items of their choice. Options include Beyond Burgers, Costco vegetable stir fry, Silk chocolate almond milk, Planet Oat oat milk, Trader Joe's quinoa, Trader Joe's Vegan Bolognese Sauce, Vegenaise, Beyond Breakfast sausage, JUST Egg, Costco açaí bowl, and Earth Balance spread. The cost to VegMichigan is more than $18 per bag on average, depending on the four items the participant selects. See attached sheet for breakdown of costs by item. 
Results of the 30-Day Plant-Based Pledge are measured through our initial registration form and survey. 
The sign-up form asks how frequently the participant eats animal-based products measured against our follow-up survey form, which asks participants whether they were able to reduce their consumption of animal-based products over the 30 days, whether they will continue to add plant-based items to their regular routines, and finally, whether they will buy any of the plant-based items they received in their bags on their own.  
Along with the Plant-Based Pledge items, participants also receive links to resources about eating out at restaurants, both locally and at chain restaurants, plant-based grocery shopping guides tailored to local stores, and tons of links to resources to get them started on their plant-based journeys.

-- Question
What other support has been secured for the project?

-- Answer
We envision at least 10 events that will rely on staff as well as volunteers for each Farmers Market distribution. We estimate an average of 2-3 volunteer hours per event, for nearly 30 volunteer hours in total.e.g., volunteer hours proposed, donated materials, or services, etc.
