Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
Run a pilot week-long zero waste challenge for the residents of Ann Arbor, including educational emails during the week explaining key aspects of the zero waste lifestyle and how they fit into the circular economy in Ann Arbor. Along with recruiting residents the challenge will serve as an opportunity to engage local businesses and encourage them to make more zero waste options available and visible. The pilot will also result in extensive permanent web infrastructure (email marketing, circular economy resources, etc) that can be reused for future challenges in Ann Arbor.
