Please provide a brief summary of the proposed project.

-- Answer
According to ZeroWaste Washtenaw, the goal of a Zero Waste event is to plan ahead to reduce waste and only distribute materials that are locally recyclable, compostable, or reusable. The Guild will take several steps in order to strive for zero waste at A2 Artoberfest Fine Art Fair in downtown Ann Arbor (Fourth Ave. and Ann Streets), MI on October 8th and 9th, 2022. 
First, we will partner with Bgreen to use compostable cups for our bar service area. Based in Ann Arbor, Bgreen is working to sell products that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Bgreen has a large array of compostable products including cups, bowls, plates, cutlery, trash can liners, and straws. By working with Bgreen, we hope to prioritize compostable cups for all beverages consumed at the event. We will also encourage our food vendors to work with Bgreen or a similar company for their food service needs. 
Second, The Guild will partner with Schupan to provide the necessary zero waste bins as well as hire students from Theta Alpha Psi Professional Sustainability Fraternity for a paid volunteer position which will actively monitor waste bins and ensure products are being disposed of in the proper bin. These paid volunteers will be compensated $12 per hour for their efforts and will be trained in advance to know how to guide fairgoers in disposing of their waste. In those waste bins, we will use compostable trash bags. Compostable bags keep the amount of plastic waste in landfills lower compared to normal bags as well as provide nutrients for the landfill as they compost. At $92.35 per case, the compostable trash bags are pricey but important in the process of zero waste. 
ZeroWaste Washtenaw is the County’s zero waste events program. The purpose of the program is to encourage and assist all event participants to minimize their environmental footprint at events through practicing zero waste. The organization has set forth several resources for organizations to utilize at events, which The Guild plans to adapt and use at A2 Artoberfest. Each of the vendors participating at A2 
Artoberfest will sign a zero waste agreement. For vendors, ZeroWaste Washtenaw outlines several rules in order to be a zero waste Vendor. Some of these rules include that vendors are ensuring products are compostable and sorting waste. Schupan will be on-sight during the event to provide an audit of the food vendors and make recommendations for changes for more compliance in the future. ZeroWaste Washtenaw also provides guidelines for volunteers. 
Finally, the artists will be informed about The Guild’s zero waste efforts and provided information on many ways they can support these efforts as well.  Artists who chose to adopt 5 or more of these recommendations will be acknowledged with signage in their booths and eligible to win a Sustainability Supporter Award, which includes an automatic invite for next year and a $50 check.

-- Question
How does the project advance sustainability?

-- Answer
First, this project will allow us to produce significantly less waste throughout the event. Moreover, the waste that is created will be less harmful to the environment. For example, big events generate big trash. A2 Artoberfest hopes to see approximately 35,000 fairgoers and therefore the amount of trash produced will be significant. It is important to combat this issue by implementing Zero Waste initiatives.
Second, our Zero Waste efforts will educate those involved and create a culture of awareness. For example, the waste bins and volunteers who are monitoring them will educate people who did not know much about it before. Moreover, the efforts extend beyond a two-day fair. The preparation going into the event is educating everyone involved. Ideally, those involved including fairgoers, volunteers, and employees will take their knowledge with them and implement it elsewhere whether it be at the next event they attend or simply in their own homes.
Lastly, The Guild is making sustainable and realistic changes. The cups and trash bags we plan to use are sourced locally and easily accessible in the future. Because we are establishing reliable partnerships in order to achieve our Zero Waste goals, we are setting ourselves up for success in the future.

-- Question
What will be the grant deliverables\?

-- Answer
Following the implementation of zero waste efforts at A2 Artoberfest we can provide a report outlining the results, lessons learned, outcomes and information on how we will continue these efforts at this event and our other events moving forward.
One way we can track results is through the responses of our vendors and volunteers. We can ask questions about how fairgoers perceived the Zero Waste initiatives. We can also determine if our vendors and volunteers were well prepared to assist us in carrying out our Zero Waste goals by engaging with them.
We can also track the success of our products. We can see how the BGreen cups hold up and track the amount of waste we throw into garbage dumpsters. At A2 Artoberfest in 2021, we filled one eight-yard front load container for trash. In the future we will aim to continue to reduce the amount of trash annually working with Schupan to review our waste amounts at the end of each event.

-- Question
What is the project timeline? When will it be finished?

-- Answer
Starting in the summer of 2022, The Guild began engaging with partners and working on the grant application. 
In August and September, The Guild will enter the final stages of planning. This includes finalizing vendors and products. Moreover, these months will consist of providing education to employees, vendors, artists, and the community. Education will happen through training and shared resources/literature.  Outreach to the community will be done largely through social media so fairgoers are prepared before they come as well as onsite through the art activity area which will include an art project created from recycled goods.
All details will be finalized prior to the start of the festival in the first week of October. During the festival on October 8th and 9th, 2022, The Guild, volunteers, Zero Waste Washtenaw, and patrons will work together to complete a successful Zero Waste weekend.

-- Question
How will project durability be ensured?

-- Answer
After establishing relationships with local resources and educating The Guild employees about Zero Waste, we will continue to implement these initiatives at our art fairs throughout the year. While not all of our events take place within Washtenaw County, we may have to reach out and find other organizations to assist us with our Zero Waste efforts outside of Ann Arbor. 
After this year we will know the real costs of implementing a Zero Waste event and can build it in our budget in the future. We can also continue to look for future sponsors and grants to help support our efforts in the future and reuse educational materials created for this year's event.
